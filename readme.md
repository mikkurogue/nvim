# My shitty ass neovim config

This is to use the neovim nighlty build so this config will only work on nighlty right now.


Mostly i just wanted to play with the package manager and see if i can be a bit speedier with stuff.

The requirements for the currently setup lsps is to have the toolchains locally installed.

Other than that, it should "just work"

there are still some fine tuning things that need doing like a more complete cmp list, diagnostics and all round polish.
